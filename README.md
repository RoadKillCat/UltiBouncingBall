## Bouncing Ball

### To admire, visit [here](https://roadkillcat.github.io/UltiBouncingBall/BallHtml.html?0.2,10,15,40,4,1,//gravity,no_balls,min_radius,max_radius,velocity,collisions).

The parameters such as *gravity*, *number of balls*, *starting velocities*, etc. can be adjusted in the *URL* after the question mark *('?')*.

You can *scroll* and *click* with your mouse to create permenent balls or bollards which the other *(non-permenent)* balls will collide with.

*Try* turning off *gravity (set to 0)*, turning down the *ball radii* and turning the *number of balls* up a **ton**... 

**A4 dimensions for inspect are 767 x 1080**
